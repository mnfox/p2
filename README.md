Description

This project is a password generator based on the xkcd password comic seen on the site. It incorporates a number of the 'challenging' features, including: letting users specify how many special characters they wish to include, scraping a text file of the most common 10000 words in the english language for it's pool of random words, and basic form validation.

To be added very soon!

I used worldlywisdom's list of the 10000 most common English words, which can be found on one of his Github repos linked below. I also used Skel and JQuery (the same as my last assignment) for my basic layout (links below).
